<!-- DESIGN 
   ------
   * This file contains the HTML structure of the "RPG Creature Search App" application.
   * The design emulates the "Aqua" user interface from Mac OS X 10 (2000s) but reinterpreted
   * in certain aspects

   * Font Choice:
   * I didn't import external fonts, instead I chose native system font stacks
   * (like Lucida Grande, Verdana) to ensure historical fidelity to the original OS and instant
   * loading performance with no external dependencies

   * Flow:
   * - Head with meta tags and link to the local style sheet
   * - Body containing a <main id="window-container"> element that acts as the frame for the
   *   main window
   * - Inside the <main>, the structure is divided into two inner containers to allow
   *   independent management, specifically:
   * - A <div> ".header-overlap-wrapper" for the title bar and controls (always visible)
   * - A <div> "#main-content-container" that wraps all the functional content

   * The main container (#main-content-container) is structured in two main blocks:
   * - #search-container: Contains the input interface. Uses a "stack" technique
   *   that overlays elements (background image, icon, and transparent text box) one
   *   on top of another, instead of placing them side by side, to perfectly recreate the complex
   *   graphic appearance of the original bar.
   * - #creature-output-box: Contains the results area. Currently has "mock-up" data (Creature #1,
   *   Pyrolynx) that serves as visual placeholder meant to facilitate my subsequent CSS design
   *   and provides the structure that will be dynamically updated via JavaScript.

        <!-- 
            * Later I use a div instead of a button because if I do that I would have
            * to write a lot of "reset" CSS to cancel all the native browser styles,
            * still risking unexpected behavior on different browsers.
            * I'll handle this accessibility "debt" with semantics and JavaScript
