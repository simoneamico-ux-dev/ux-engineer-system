### The Project
Grade management application developed with JavaScript, which calculates class averages, assigns letter grades, and automatically determines student promotion or failure.

### Source Code

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="js" label="script.js">

```js
function getAverage(scores) {
  let sum = 0;

  for (const score of scores) {
    sum += score;
  }

  return sum / scores.length;
}

function getGrade(score) {
  if (score === 100) {
    return "A++";
  } else if (score >= 90) {
    return "A";
  } else if (score >= 80) {
    return "B";
  } else if (score >= 70) {
    return "C";
  } else if (score >= 60) {
    return "D";
  } else {
    return "F";
  }
}

function hasPassingGrade(score) {
  return getGrade(score) !== "F";
}

function studentMsg(totalScores, studentScore) {

  let classAverage = getAverage(totalScores);
  let studentVote = getGrade(studentScore);
  let passed = hasPassingGrade(studentScore);
  
  if (passed) {
    return "Class average: " + classAverage + ". Your grade: " + studentVote + ". You passed the course.";

  }
  else {
    return "Class average: " + classAverage + ". Your grade: " + studentVote + ". You failed the course.";

  }

}
console.log(studentMsg([92, 88, 12, 77, 57, 100, 67, 38, 97, 89], 37));
```

</TabItem> 

</Tabs>

### The Practical Utility Revelation

In this short project I understood how **useful JavaScript** can be and how it can simplify life, in this case for a teacher who needs to understand the average and have immediate feedback on promotion or failure.

### The UI Necessity Insight

I recognize how necessary a **UI to accompany a tool like this** actually is. A teacher can't start typing various grades into console.log - they need a dedicated, pleasant and immediately understandable UI.

As **Steve Krug states in "Don't Make Me Think"**: the interface must be **self-explanatory**, without any necessary explanation of how it works. The interface must speak for itself.

### What I Learned

**Modular Functions:**
- **getAverage()** - average calculation with for...of loop
- **getGrade()** - numerical score to letter grade conversion
- **hasPassingGrade()** - boolean check for promotion
- **studentMsg()** - compositive function that combines everything

**Programming Patterns:**
- **Separation of concerns** - each function has a specific task
- **Code reusability** - functions calling each other
- **String concatenation** for formatted output
- **Multiple conditions** with else if for classification

### Reflection

This project solidified my understanding that **JavaScript is powerful but needs an interface**. The logic works perfectly, but without an intuitive UI it remains inaccessible to end users.

It was the first time I clearly saw the **gap between functionality and usability**, a gap that as a future UX Engineer I'll always have to keep in mind.
