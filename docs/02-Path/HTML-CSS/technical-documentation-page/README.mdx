                <header><h2>Introduction to Git</h2></header>
                <p>Git is like a "magic diary" for your code. Imagine writing a book: every time you finish a chapter, you take a photo of the page. If you mess something up later, you can always go back to that photo!</p>
                <p>Git keeps track of all the changes you make to your files. It's like having a time machine for your project: you can see what you changed, when you changed it, and why you changed it.</p>
                <code>git --version</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeps track of modifications</li>
                    <li>Allows you to go back in time</li>
                    <li>Facilitates teamwork</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Git_Commands">
                <header><h2>Basic Git Commands</h2></header>
                <p>Basic Git commands are like the most important words of a foreign language. With these few commands you can already do a lot!</p>
                <p>The first command you'll always use is git init, which transforms a normal folder into a "Git warehouse". It's like saying "from today this folder is special, keep track of everything!"</p>
                <p>Then there's git add, which is like putting files in a box before shipping it. And git commit is like sealing the box and writing on it what it contains.</p>
                <code>git init
git add .
git commit -m "My first commit"</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>git init: initializes a repository</li>
                    <li>git add: prepares files for commit</li>
                    <li>git commit: saves changes permanently</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Understanding_GitHub">
                <header><h2>Understanding GitHub</h2></header>
                <p>GitHub is like a "social network for programmers". It's a place where you can store your Git projects online and share them with the world.</p>
                <p>Think of it as Instagram, but instead of photos, you share code. You can follow other programmers, "like" (star) their projects, and even contribute to them!</p>
                <p>GitHub makes collaboration incredibly easy. It's like having a shared workspace where everyone can see what others are doing and contribute their ideas.</p>
                <code>git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repository hosting: store projects online</li>
                    <li>Collaboration tools: work with others</li>
                    <li>Open source community: share and contribute</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Working_with_Branches">
                <header><h2>Working with Branches</h2></header>
                <p>Branches are one of Git's most powerful features. Imagine your project as a tree: the main trunk is the "main" branch, and you can create branches to try new features.</p>
                <p>If you're working on a new feature, you create a separate branch. It's like having a copy of your project where you can experiment without breaking the original!</p>
                <p>When your feature is ready, you can "merge" the branch with the main one. It's like grafting the branch onto the main tree.</p>
                <code>git branch new-feature
git checkout new-feature
git switch -c another-feature</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>main/master: main branch</li>
                    <li>feature branches: for new functionalities</li>
                    <li>hotfix branches: for urgent bug fixes</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Collaboration_and_Pull_Requests">
                <header><h2>Collaboration and Pull Requests</h2></header>
                <p>Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. It's like knocking on the door and saying "Hey, I improved your project, want to see?"</p>
                <p>When you make a Pull Request, you're asking the project owner to "pull" your changes into their repository. It's a polite way to propose changes.</p>
                <p>Before your changes get accepted, other developers can review your code, suggest improvements, or approve the changes. It's like having a group of friends check your homework before you turn it in!</p>
                <code>git push origin my-feature</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fork: copy a repository to your account</li>
                    <li>Pull Request: propose changes</li>
                    <li>Code Review: other developers check your code</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Git_Configuration">
                <header><h2>Git Configuration</h2></header>
                <p>Before using Git for the first time, it's like introducing yourself: you need to say who you are! Git needs to know your name and email to "sign" your commits.</p>
                <p>Configuration is done once on your computer, and it's like filling out a digital ID card. Every time you make a commit, Git will use this information.</p>
                <p>You can also configure your preferred text editor and many other details to customize Git according to your preferences.</p>
                <code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Global configuration: applies to all projects</li>
                    <li>Local configuration: only for one project</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Remote_Repositories">
                <header><h2>Remote Repositories</h2></header>
                <p>Remote repositories are like "backup copies" of your project stored on the internet. The most famous is GitHub, but there are others like GitLab and Bitbucket.</p>
                <p>It's like having your personal diary (local repository) and a copy in a bank vault (remote repository). If your computer breaks, the copy is always safe!</p>
                <p>You can connect your local project to multiple remote repositories simultaneously. It's useful when you want to backup on different services.</p>
                <code>git remote -v
git push origin main
git pull origin main</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>origin: standard name for the main repository</li>
                    <li>upstream: original repository when you fork</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Merge_Conflicts">
                <header><h2>Merge Conflicts</h2></header>
                <p>Merge conflicts are like when two people modify the same sentence of a document simultaneously. Git doesn't know which version to keep!</p>
                <p>Don't be scared of conflicts: they're completely normal when working in teams. It's like two chefs modifying the same recipe - someone has to decide which ingredient to use.</p>
                <p>When it happens, Git shows you exactly where the differences are and you have to choose what to keep. It's like being a judge deciding between two versions.</p>
                <code><<<<<<< HEAD
My version of the code
=======
Someone else's version
>>>>>>> branch-name</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>HEAD: the version in your current branch</li>
                    <li>Markers: <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>> show the conflict</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Git_History_and_Logs">
                <header><h2>Git History and Logs</h2></header>
                <p>Git history is like a detailed log of everything that happened to your project. Each commit is like a diary entry with date, time, and description.</p>
                <p>With git log you can see who did what and when. It's incredibly useful for understanding how the project evolved or finding when a bug was introduced.</p>
                <p>You can also see differences between different versions, like comparing two photos of the same place taken at different times.</p>
                <code>git log --oneline
git show commit-hash
git diff HEAD~1</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>git log: shows complete history</li>
                    <li>git show: details of a specific commit</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="GitHub_Issues_and_Projects">
                <header><h2>GitHub Issues and Projects</h2></header>
                <p>GitHub Issues are like a public "to-do list" for your project. You can report bugs, propose new features, or ask questions.</p>
                <p>It's like having a bulletin board where anyone can stick post-it notes with suggestions or problem reports. Much more organized than scattered comments!</p>
                <p>Projects are like digital Kanban boards: you can organize Issues in columns like "To Do", "In Progress", "Done". Perfect for managing complex projects!</p>
                <code># In a commit message
git commit -m "Fix login bug - closes #42"</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bug reports: error notifications</li>
                    <li>Feature requests: proposals for new functions</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Git_Best_Practices">
                <header><h2>Git Best Practices</h2></header>
                <p>Using Git well is like driving: there are unwritten rules that make everything safer and more organized for everyone.</p>
                <p>Commit messages should be clear and descriptive, like photo captions: "Add login function" is much better than "random stuff".</p>
                <p>Make small and frequent commits instead of one giant one at the end. It's like saving a document every paragraph instead of only at the end - if something goes wrong, you've lost less work!</p>
                <code># Good example
git commit -m "Add user authentication system"
# Bad example
git commit -m "stuff"</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Frequent and small commits</li>
                    <li>Descriptive messages</li>
                    <li>Branch for each feature</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Troubleshooting_Common_Issues">
                <header><h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2></header>
                <p>Everyone makes mistakes with Git, even experienced programmers! It's normal and there are always solutions. It's like learning to ride a bike - some falls are inevitable.</p>
                <p>The most useful command ever is git status. It's like asking "where am I?" when you're lost. It always tells you what's happening and what you can do.</p>
                <p>If you made a wrong commit, don't panic! Git keeps track of everything and you can almost always go back. It's like having a very powerful "undo" button.</p>
                <code>git status
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git stash</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>git status: to always orient yourself</li>
                    <li>git reset: to undo commits</li>
                    <li>git stash: to save temporary work</li>

                <header><h2>Understanding GitHub</h2></header>
                <p>GitHub is like a "social network for programmers". It's a place where you can store your Git projects online and share them with the world.</p>
                <p>Think of it as Instagram, but instead of photos, you share code. You can follow other programmers, "like" (star) their projects, and even contribute to them!</p>
                <p>GitHub makes collaboration incredibly easy. It's like having a shared workspace where everyone can see what others are doing and contribute their ideas.</p>
                <code>git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repository hosting: store projects online</li>
                    <li>Collaboration tools: work with others</li>
                    <li>Open source community: share and contribute</li>

            <section class="main-section" id="Working_with_Branches">
                <header><h2>Working with Branches</h2></header>
                <p>Branches are one of Git's most powerful features. Imagine your project as a tree: the main trunk is the "main" branch, and you can create branches to try new features.</p>
                <p>If you're working on a new feature, you create a separate branch. It's like having a copy of your project where you can experiment without breaking the original!</p>
                <p>When your feature is ready, you can "merge" the branch with the main one. It's like grafting the branch onto the main tree.</p>
                <code>git branch new-feature
git checkout new-feature
git switch -c another-feature</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>main/master: main branch</li>
                    <li>feature branches: for new functionalities</li>
                    <li>hotfix branches: for urgent bug fixes</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Collaboration_and_Pull_Requests">
                <header><h2>Collaboration and Pull Requests</h2></header>
                <p>Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. It's like knocking on the door and saying "Hey, I improved your project, want to see?"</p>
                <p>When you make a Pull Request, you're asking the project owner to "pull" your changes into their repository. It's a polite way to propose changes.</p>
                <p>Before your changes get accepted, other developers can review your code, suggest improvements, or approve the changes. It's like having a group of friends check your homework before you turn it in!</p>
                <code>git push origin my-feature</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fork: copy a repository to your account</li>
                    <li>Pull Request: propose changes</li>
                    <li>Code Review: other developers check your code</li>

            <section class="main-section" id="Git_Configuration">
                <header><h2>Git Configuration</h2></header>
                <p>Before using Git for the first time, it's like introducing yourself: you need to say who you are! Git needs to know your name and email to "sign" your commits.</p>
                <p>Configuration is done once on your computer, and it's like filling out a digital ID card. Every time you make a commit, Git will use this information.</p>
                <p>You can also configure your preferred text editor and many other details to customize Git according to your preferences.</p>
                <code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Global configuration: applies to all projects</li>

            <section class="main-section" id="Remote_Repositories">
                <header><h2>Remote Repositories</h2></header>
                <p>Remote repositories are like "backup copies" of your project stored on the internet. The most famous is GitHub, but there are others like GitLab and Bitbucket.</p>
                <p>It's like having your personal diary (local repository) and a copy in a bank vault (remote repository). If your computer breaks, the copy is always safe!</p>
                <p>You can connect your local project to multiple remote repositories simultaneously. It's useful when you want to backup on different services.</p>
                <code>git remote -v
git push origin main
git pull origin main</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>origin: standard name for the main repository</li>
                    <li>upstream: original repository when you fork</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="main-section" id="Merge_Conflicts">
                <header><h2>Merge Conflicts</h2></header>
                <p>Merge conflicts are like when two people modify the same sentence of a document simultaneously. Git doesn't know which version to keep!</p>
                <p>Don't be scared of conflicts: they're completely normal when working in teams. It's like two chefs modifying the same recipe - someone has to decide which ingredient to use.</p>
                <p>When it happens, Git shows you exactly where the differences are and you have to choose what to keep. It's like being a judge deciding between two versions.</p>
                <code><<<<<<< HEAD
My version of the code
=======
Someone else's version
>>>>>>> branch-name</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>HEAD: the version in your current branch</li>
                    <li>Markers: <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>> show the conflict</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="main-section" id="Git_History_and_Logs">
                <header><h2>Git History and Logs</h2></header>
                <p>Git history is like a detailed log of everything that happened to your project. Each commit is like a diary entry with date, time, and description.</p>
                <p>With git log you can see who did what and when. It's incredibly useful for understanding how the project evolved or finding when a bug was introduced.</p>
                <p>You can also see differences between different versions, like comparing two photos of the same place taken at different times.</p>
                <code>git log --oneline
git show commit-hash
git diff HEAD~1</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>git log: shows complete history</li>

            <section class="main-section" id="GitHub_Issues_and_Projects">
                <header><h2>GitHub Issues and Projects</h2></header>
                <p>GitHub Issues are like a public "to-do list" for your project. You can report bugs, propose new features, or ask questions.</p>
                <p>It's like having a bulletin board where anyone can stick post-it notes with suggestions or problem reports. Much more organized than scattered comments!</p>
                <p>Projects are like digital Kanban boards: you can organize Issues in columns like "To Do", "In Progress", "Done". Perfect for managing complex projects!</p>
                <code># In a commit message
git commit -m "Fix login bug - closes #42"</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bug reports: error notifications</li>

                <header><h2>Git Best Practices</h2></header>
                <p>Using Git well is like driving: there are unwritten rules that make everything safer and more organized for everyone.</p>
                <p>Commit messages should be clear and descriptive, like photo captions: "Add login function" is much better than "random stuff".</p>
                <p>Make small and frequent commits instead of one giant one at the end. It's like saving a document every paragraph instead of only at the end - if something goes wrong, you've lost less work!</p>
                <code># Good example
git commit -m "Add user authentication system"
# Bad example
git commit -m "stuff"</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Frequent and small commits</li>
                    <li>Descriptive messages</li>

                <p>Everyone makes mistakes with Git, even experienced programmers! It's normal and there are always solutions. It's like learning to ride a bike - some falls are inevitable.</p>
                <p>The most useful command ever is git status. It's like asking "where am I?" when you're lost. It always tells you what's happening and what you can do.</p>
                <p>If you made a wrong commit, don't panic! Git keeps track of everything and you can almost always go back. It's like having a very powerful "undo" button.</p>
                <code>git status
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git stash</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>git status: to always orient yourself</li>

### The Evolution of Approach

I applied everything I'm learning from Refactoring UI. In these 3 days I also finished the 2nd Google UX course (2/8) and it was fascinating to learn **persona** and **user journey** and apply them directly to the project, especially because they're taught differently compared to Breccia's course.

### The Disciplined Method

I rigorously followed the requirements for names and elements requested by freeCodeCamp. Other times I went freestyle, then adjusted according to required specifications. It was much faster this way, even though I had less fun. I like that sense of freedom, but I understand I still need to learn all methods before autonomously choosing the best one.

### The Driver's License Analogy

A bit like getting a driver's license: you learn exactly as the instructor wants, but then the steering wheel height, gear changes, maneuvers will be up to you to decide.

### Reflection on Work Teams

I understand it's also necessary at a corporate level. Startups and very small teams are one thing where your work has a huge impact, in larger teams you'll necessarily be a small percentage and won't be able to decide everything, even though I'm sure you can still have enormous impact there too.

### The Content Choice

I decided to choose **Git and GitHub** as the documentation subject. I could have chosen HTML and CSS which I'm starting to understand, but I already have the Handbook for that. I opted to learn something I don't know thoroughly like the platform I'm writing on, researching and then reporting on the page.

**Surprise:** I was amazed that I already knew the vast majority of functions from when I first researched them about 2 months ago.

### The Refactoring UI Method in Practice

I approached it following the Refactoring UI method:

1. **Last night** until late I reviewed my notes
2. **This morning** I transferred everything I'd need for the project to a txt file
3. **I called it "in advance"** - colors, distances, fonts, everything predefined
4. **Grayscale design** first to establish hierarchies and distances without being "distracted" by color
5. **Design something functional** then iterate until perfect

I really liked this method!

### The Discovered Limit and Discipline

I would have also liked to add that when scrolling the page, the navbar would show exactly where you were. I immediately discovered that was **JavaScript** territory, which I'm still waiting to learn. With pure CSS I could only achieve having a nav link stay highlighted after clicking it, but I wanted something interactive.

I decided to **be patient** even though I can't wait to start JavaScript. This is my path: it doesn't make sense to pick things here and there that I haven't studied, until I've internalized and thoroughly understood them.

### The Final Goal

I want to internalize all this. I'd like to reach the **confidence** of sitting down and already knowing what's best to do, a bit like when I use Figma. Nevertheless, I admit I have much more fun coding, as I said in some past README.

### What I Learned

- **Technical documentation** structured and navigable
- **Rigorous implementation** of specific requirements
- **Refactoring UI methodology** applied to a real project
- **Git/GitHub** deepened while documenting them
- **Design system planning** with "in advance" file
