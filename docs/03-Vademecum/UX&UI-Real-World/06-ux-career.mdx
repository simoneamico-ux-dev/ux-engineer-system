# UX & UI Real World Vademecum

# Part VI: The Business of Design

Knowing how to design is useless if you can't sell the value of your design. This section transforms "doing jobs" into "providing engineering consulting."

## Presenting Work

### 31. The Engineer's Case Study

**Not "What I did," but "What I solved"**

**What it does:** Demonstrates your value by telling the story of problem solving, not just showing final screens.

**The Analogy:** Imagine a doctor presenting a case. They don't say "I used scalpel no. 4 and blue suture thread." They say: "The patient had appendicitis (Problem), we operated urgently (Action), and now they are running a marathon (Result)."

**The "STAR" Structure:**
1.  **Situation (Problem):** "Factory workers wasted 10 minutes per shift logging in."
2.  **Task (Goal):** "Reduce login time to 30 seconds."
3.  **Action (What you did):** "I replaced complex passwords with NFC badge login and a simplified PIN."
4.  **Result (Data):** "Time reduced by 95%. Estimated savings of 50 man/hours per month."

**Red Flag:** A portfolio with only final interface images ("UI Porn") without explaining the "Why" is an artist's portfolio, not a UX Engineer's.

## Financial Management

### 32. The Quote: Selling Value, Not Hours

**The Price of the Bolt**

**What it does:** Shifts negotiation from "how long does it take" to "how much do I make you earn."

**The Analogy:** The old story of the technician fixing the ship with one hammer blow.
* Bill: €10,000.
* Client: "For one hammer blow?"
* Technician: "€1 for the hammer blow, €9,999 for knowing *where* to hit."

**The Strategy:**
Don't say "It takes me 10 hours at €50/h." Say: "This redesign will reduce customer support calls by 30%. How much does customer support cost you today? €100,000 a year? My project will save you €30,000 a year. The project price is €5,000."
Sell the result (the plane flying), not the effort (the hours spent tightening screws).

### 33. Templates and Proposals

**Business Automation**

**What it does:** Reduces time spent on bureaucracy to focus on design.

**The Approach:**
Don't write every quote from scratch. Create your bureaucratic "Design System."
* **Standard Skeleton:** Who I am, Method (GDD), Phases (Research, Wireframe, UI, Test), Costs.
* **Customization:** Change only the "Problem" and the "Proposed Solution."

Having a solid template makes you look immediately more professional. The client thinks: "This person has a tested process, they aren't improvising."
